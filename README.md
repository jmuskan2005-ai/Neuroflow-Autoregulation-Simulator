# Neuroflow-Autoregulation-Simulator
The NeuroFlow Autoregulation Simulator shows how the brain keeps blood flow stable as blood pressure changes. It uses a smooth mathematical model to mimic vessel widening and tightening and compares healthy and stroke responses, highlighting why autoregulation protects brain tissue and maintains healthy function.
