# Neuroflow-Autoregulation-Simulator
The NeuroFlow Autoregulation Simulator is a simple, math-based project that shows how the brain keeps its blood flow steady even when blood pressure rises or falls. It uses a smooth logistic model to mimic how blood vessels naturally widen or tighten and compares the behaviour of a healthy brain with that of a stroke-affected one.
This project is perfect for understanding the basics of cerebral autoregulation through a mix of biology, calculus, and visual simulation.

# ✨ Features
Simulates cerebral blood flow using a logistic autoregulation model
Shows how vessels dilate and constrict as pressure changes
Plots healthy vs stroke responses for easy comparison
Simple and clean Python code (VS Code compatible)
Great for biology, neuroscience, or calculus-based presentations

# 🧠 What Autoregulation Means
Your brain protects itself by keeping blood flow constant, no matter how your blood pressure fluctuates. Healthy brains do this very well. After a stroke, this ability becomes weaker.
This simulator visualizes this difference in a clear, easy-to-understand plot.

# 🧮 Maths Used
Uses a logistic differential model to describe how cerebral blood flow changes with pressure
Applies derivatives to show how fast vessels react (rate of dilation/constriction)
Identifies critical pressure points using slope analysis
Compares two parameter sets (healthy vs stroke) to show weakened autoregulation
Uses curve behavior and limits to show stable vs unstable blood-flow zones
